I want to thank Epic Games, especially Brian Karis for sharing their Physical Based Shading Approach with the world.

The source within this folder is mostly based on their Siggraph 2013 Course. Please, check out the [website of this course](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/) and the [presentation of Epic Games](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/rad/s2013_pbs_rad_slides.pdf) and [their course notes](http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf) to see the course presentation with note (containing the original code snippets)
